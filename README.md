# RouteWISELY - Municipal Route Optimization Application

**Version:** 1.0 (MVP)
**Project Status:** Milestone 1 - Discovery & Design

---

## 1. Introduction & Overview

RouteWISELY is a comprehensive mobile and web application designed to assist municipal public works departments in efficiently managing, executing, and tracking driving routes for tasks such as road maintenance, street sweeping, and infrastructure inspections. The application optimizes routes from ESRI Shapefiles, provides turn-by-turn navigation via Google Maps, visually tracks completed road segments, and collects GPS data for robust reporting and analysis.

## 2. Core MVP Features

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on the following core functionalities:

* **Shapefile Integration:** Supervisors can upload ESRI Shapefiles to define the municipal road network.
* **Route Optimization:** The system calculates an optimized route to cover all selected road segments efficiently.
* **Mobile Navigation:** Drivers receive turn-by-turn navigation on iOS and Android devices powered by Google Maps.
* **Live Route Tracking:** The driver's mobile map visually differentiates completed segments from pending ones in real-time.
* **Safety Features:** The navigation system will provide alerts for known hazards like one-way streets and low bridges.
* **Supervisor Dashboard:** A web-based dashboard provides supervisors with a view of active routes, driver status, and overall progress.
* **Authentication:** Secure, role-based login for both drivers (mobile) and supervisors (web).

## 3. Technology Ecosystem

This project will be built on a modern, scalable technology stack designed for rapid development and robust performance.

* **Mobile App (iOS/Android):** Flutter via FlutterFlow
* **Web Dashboard:** React.js
* **Backend Framework:** Cloud Functions for Firebase using Node.js or Python
* **Main Database:** Cloud Firestore & Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) with PostGIS extension
* **File & Data Syncing:** Google Cloud Storage and Firebase Cloud Firestore
* **User Authentication:** Firebase Authentication
* **Mapping & Navigation:** Google Maps Platform (SDKs, Directions API)
* **CI/CD & Hosting:** GitHub Actions, Docker, and Google Cloud Run
