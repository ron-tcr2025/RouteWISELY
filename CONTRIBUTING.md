# Contributing to RouteWISELY

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the RouteWISELY project. To ensure a smooth and effective development process, please adhere to the following guidelines.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Create an Issue:** Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, please create an issue in the GitHub repository to discuss the proposed changes. This allows for clear tracking and collaboration.
2.  **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main` for your changes. Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/user-login` or `bugfix/map-rendering-issue`).
3.  **Commit Changes:** Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive commit messages that reference the issue number (e.g., `feat: Implement user login form #12`).
4.  **Pull Request (PR):** Push your branch to your fork and submit a pull request to the main repository's `main` branch. Please provide a detailed description of the changes in your PR and link it to the relevant issue.
5.  **Code Review:** All pull requests will be reviewed by the project lead. Please be prepared to make changes based on the feedback provided. Once approved, the PR will be merged.

## Coding Standards

-   Follow the **Effective Dart** and **Flutter** style guides for all mobile app code.
-   Follow a standard style guide (e.g., Airbnb) for any web dashboard (React) code.
-   Ensure all code is well-commented, especially complex logic.
-   Update relevant documentation in the `/docs` folder with your changes.
